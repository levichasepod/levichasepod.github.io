                        <p>This pod has been created as a response to harm that Levi has caused in the various
                            communities they are apart of. The pod gives those who have been harmed an opportunity to
                            report and be apart of Accountability processes to their level of comfort and capacity. The
                            goal is to help Levi reduce the harm of their actions, change their behaviour and support
                            healing in those who have been negatively affected.</p>

                        <p>As a third party, the pod can be a point of contact for those who don’t wish to interact with
                            Levi directly. There are many ways that reporters can interact with the pod and the
                            intention is to center the reporters needs and honour what they think should be done to
                            achieve Accountability.</p>

                        <p>Available on this website are ways to report harm, a documentation of the values and
                            objectives of the pod and a brief bio of each of the members. This is work that all members
                            are new to and we are committed to learning and growing through this process.</p>

                        <p>If you have any questions, concerns or feedback, please do not hesitate to contact any of the
                            members at any time.</p>

                            <h4>Gaëlle</h4>
                            <p>Hello, my name is Gaelle and I have known Levi for about a year and a half. I currently
                                work in the field of research
                                and I am a white, cisgender woman with class privilege. Like most people, I have both
                                been harmed and caused harm to
                                others, and I believe it is important to work towards improving ourselves and supporting
                                both individual and community
                                accountability.</p>

                            <p>As a feminist, accountability is very important to me. I believe it is crucial for folks
                                who have caused harm to work on
                                bettering themselves and I am committed to supporting that.
                                I am a part of this pod because I believe that it is crucial to support folks who have
                                caused harm in their journey to
                                bettering themselves. I’m looking forward to working with Levi and the rest of the pod
                                through this accountability
                                process.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="team-box" style="background-color:white; margin-top: 80px">
                            <div class="team-image">
                                <img src="images/image1.jpeg" alt="">
                            </div>
                            <h4>Eric</h4>
                            <p>My name is Eric, and I've known Levi since 2017. My vocations are in two divergent
                                fields: in computers, and in counselling. I am white, born in Canada, and weakly
                                identify as cisgender male. I am on a path of learning to identify and diffuse power
                                relations between individuals embedded in intimate and social relationships, and
                                re-learning emotions and the meaning of our lives.</p>
                            <p>My interest in serving on Levi's accountability pod are numerous, but I'd like to
                                highlight two. First, people who are harmed are very often disempowered by the response
                                paths available for seeking safety, healing, or resolution. Having been harmed usually
                                puts them in a position of diminished freedom and power. Accountability pods are
                                intended to offer an avenue to address harms, which can protect the interests of the
                                person reporting harm. Second, accountability pods as a process seem like they have a
                                better chance at leading people who have harmed towards improved empathy,
                                self-awareness, and safer behavior, compared to other avenues that might leave them
                                defensive, desperate, and denying.</p>
                            <p>My main job in Levi's pod is to be soft in two directions, as an interface between any
                                reporter of harm (or their own supporters and proxies) and Levi, in ways that fully
                                respect the wishes of the reporter, and in ways that maintain the goal of keeping Levi
                                accountable.</p>

                            <p ><br></p>
                            <p ><span >I feel really sad that you haven&rsquo;t gotten back to me. I thought we had made a connection. Having people drop contact like this out of the blue is really painful for me. Stimulates my childhood abandonment trauma.&nbsp;</span></p>
                            <p ><br></p>
                            <p ><span >If there&rsquo;s anything that I did or said to upset you, I&rsquo;d love to know, or just whatever context has led to you not responding anymore.&nbsp;</span></p>
                            <p ><br></p>
                            <p ><span >&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
                            <p ><br></p>
                            <p ><span >A situation like this could have also resulted in me sending follow up messages months later. Always &ldquo;gently&rdquo; checking in, but nevertheless, not respecting the implied messaging that this person is no longer wishing to be in contact.&nbsp;</span></p>
                            <p ><br></p>
                            <p ><span >I&rsquo;m going to talk a little bit about my mental health experience/trauma not because it excuses my behaviour, but rather it gives context to why I do these things, when other people, without trauma, or different kinds of trauma, would never think to do this.&nbsp;</span></p>
                            <p ><br></p>
                            <p ><span >I have borderline personality disorder. A big part of that for me means having these really intense emotional responses to real or perceived abandonment and rejection. I experienced a lot of neglect as a child from my parents, which has resulted in these triggers and emotional responses when people stop responding to my messages.&nbsp;</span></p>
                            <p ><br></p>
                            <p ><span >Over the years, I&rsquo;ve done a lot of work on how I communicate with people. I started learning in my early twenties that the way we are socialized to communicate is often not very healthy at all. I prided myself in learning to communicate in this very compassionate and heart felt way. Instead of lashing out at people I learned to speak my feelings and needs.&nbsp;</span></p>
                            <p ><br></p>
                            <p ><span >Because I had done so much work on how I communicate and interact with people, I came to find this new sense of empowerment around being open and honest with people about my emotional experience. And how my interactions with individual people affected my emotional experience.&nbsp;</span></p>
                            <p ><br></p>
                            <p ><span >So for years I&rsquo;ve employed this kind of gentle and seemingly heart centred way of checking back in with people when they&rsquo;ve stopped responding. In my mind, because I was being so sweet and kind about these follow up messages, there couldn&rsquo;t be anything wrong or bad about them. An analogy I used recently was that it was as though I was filling a wrecking ball with candy and fluffy stuffed animals. No matter how sweet and kind I thought I was being, I was still blowing through someone&apos;s implicit boundary.&nbsp;</span></p>
                            <p ><br></p>
                            <p ><span >I had to learn something very simple after getting the feedback that I was emotionally coercive and non consensual with the way I communicate. <strong>If someone doesn&rsquo;t respond, that means they don&rsquo;t want to talk to me</strong>. &nbsp;</span></p>
                            <p ><br></p>
                            <p ><span >I&rsquo;ve gotten stuck on this simple concept a lot over the last year or so. Some people that I was persistent and pushy with would eventually respond days, weeks, or months later and say that they were so sorry they hadn&rsquo;t responded, gave their reasons for why they didn&rsquo;t, and even said that they appreciated my messages because to them it showed that I still cared and was thinking about them.&nbsp;</span></p>
                            <p ><br></p>
                            <p ><span >But when I think about this really rationally; those instances were few and far between. And I used them as an excuse to keep doing this behaviour. Because ultimately these persistent messages gave me something. Or the illusion of something. And that was relief from my trauma trigger and emotional pain.&nbsp;</span></p>
                            <p ><br></p>
                            <p ><span >This is one of many ways I have made my trauma other people&apos;s burden to bear. Instead of taking responsibility for my emotional experience, I would push past people&rsquo;s boundaries to get this relief.&nbsp;</span></p>
                            <p ><br></p>
                            <p ><span >A number of months ago I was sharing with my accountability pod, an experience I was having with someone whom I thought I was connecting well with online. They had stopped responding and I shared the three follow up messages I&rsquo;d sent in the week or so since they last responded. One of my accountability people got really upset and was baffled that I would find this behaviour appropriate. It was hard to receive but it was what I needed to hear. What I was doing was really inappropriate. Especially with someone I had never even met in real life yet.&nbsp;</span></p>
                            <p ><br></p>
                            <p ><span >Since then I have employed a couple of strategies to avoid this behaviour. The main one is that when someone stops responding to me, I may send one follow up message, but after that, if I don&rsquo;t hear back for about a week, I will unmatch them or delete the contact so I can&rsquo;t message them again.&nbsp;</span></p>
                            <p ><br></p>
                            <p ><span >The reality is that I have not yet been able to fully heal these triggers. And thus they create a level of fixation and obsession that makes it really hard for me to resist pushing past that boundary.&nbsp;</span></p>
                            <p ><br></p>
                            <p ><span >I was telling a friend recently that until this year, I had never unmatched anyone on tinder or any other online dating platform. I struggle with this scarcity mentality around romantic and sexual connections and so even if someone hasn&rsquo;t responded to me for months I will still keep our match active. Which only increases my triggers and results in more obsessive and pushy behaviour. I now routinely unmatch and delete peoples&rsquo; contacts when they don&rsquo;t respond.&nbsp;</span></p>
                            <p ><br></p>
                            <p ><span >On a deeper healing level, the big way I&rsquo;m working to combat this behaviour is by healing my wounded inner child. I have come to learn that at the root of all of this, is a deep pain that needs to be healed. And so much of that work needs to be done with myself internally. Not just in therapy or mental health support groups.</span></p>
                            <p ><br></p>
                            <p ><span >Emotional coercion:</span></p>
                            <p ><br></p>
                            <p ><span >Over the years I&rsquo;ve been given the feedback that I am emotionally coercive. It&rsquo;s taken me a while to unpack and properly understand this feedback. One way that I&rsquo;ve made sense of this is looking at the context of the connection and the emotional language I choose to use.&nbsp;</span></p>
                            <p ><br></p>
                            <p ><span >If I have no history with someone, no built up trust, and I start using very emotional language to describe how I&rsquo;m experiencing their lack of contact, it can understandably land as emotional coercion. I&rsquo;m essentially using my emotions to influence them to do something that I want.&nbsp;</span></p>
                            <p ><br></p>
                            <p ><span >I believe this kind of emotional language makes more sense and would be more appropriate if I had a long standing connection with someone. But to a complete stranger it can be very off putting.&nbsp;</span></p>
                            <p ><br></p>
                            <p ><span >My perceived impact of this behaviour:</span></p>
                            <p ><br></p>
                            <p ><span >I haven&rsquo;t received very much direct feedback about this behaviour. One person said my messages made them feel harassed. Which I think makes a lot sense. I would imagine that for a lot of people this behaviour creates a sense that they aren&rsquo;t respected. That they aren&rsquo;t safe. I&rsquo;ve been perpetuating this culture of masculine people feeling entitled to other people&rsquo;s attention and time.&nbsp;</span></p>
                            <p ><br></p>
                            <p ><span >I&rsquo;ve also come to learn that it&rsquo;s very likely that a lot of people choose to stop responding or &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; me because in so many instances, when masculine people are told directly that they don&rsquo;t want to be in contact, there is often an aggressive and sometimes violent reaction. Knowing this helps put things into perspective and make peace with the fact that sometimes this is the safest and most manageable way for someone to end a connection.&nbsp;</span></p>
                            <p ><br></p>
                            <p ><span >This is behaviour that I am committed to consistently working on. I don&rsquo;t want to become so confident in my changed ways that I start to let this kind of communication slide. And when it does I plan to be accountable and express my regret for this behaviour, check in on impact and ask what I can do to amend any harm that I&rsquo;ve caused.&nbsp;</span></p>
